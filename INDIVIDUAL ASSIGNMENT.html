        <p>My journey has taken me through many experiences. Started with an Information Management student where I have learn lot of things, such as coding, using Microsoft PowerPoints, Excel and Word, and cataloging. Then, I joined Komander Kesatria UiTM Rembau.
            Being a part of Komander Kesatria UiTM Rembau has gave me a lot of oppurtunity to develop and polish some skills.
            It helps me to get out of my comfort zone and try a lot of things also gave me lot of experiences. Throughout joining the Komander I'm able to expand my experiance by doing a volunteer work.
            First, I volunteers in Percussion Se-Malaysia and then KARISMA UiTM. As a volunteer in Percussion, I have been assigned to help in managing the residence of percussion participants at UiTM Rembau.
            As for KARISMA, I was responsible in assisting the referee as a Linesmen. Other than that, I also have participated in Negeri Sembilan's Independence Parade, Furthermore, I have undergone an internship in Leasing department at AEON BIG Subang Jaya.
            These experiences have shaped me into someone who is good at many skills, such as teamwork, time management, coding, critical thinking, and adaptability and flexibility. Here are some of the pictures as a proof of my experiences.</p>
